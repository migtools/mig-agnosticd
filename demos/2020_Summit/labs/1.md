## 1.1 Getting your dedicated lab environments using Guid Grabber

On your laptop, open <span style="color:red">**TWO**</span> browser tabs to [*Lab GUID Assignment page*](https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_tester).

From this page, you will be assigned your unique GUID, which you will use to access your unique lab environment and systems.

For this lab you will need two different environments (v3.11 and v4.1), pay attention while selecting the *Lab Code* from the drop down list.
